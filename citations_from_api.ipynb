Pus cells are WBCs - white blood cells, and less than 5 pus cells / hpf is considered to be normal, but this finding is often highlighted in red as being abnormal, and this often causes both the doctor as well as the patient to worry.The WHO Manual states that less than 1 million WBC per ml is normal, but the majority of labs never bother to measure the actual concentration of the WBCs - the technician simply eyeballs the sample and estimate this in terms of rounds cells seen in each visual field when scanning the samples through the microscope. Patients are worried that these pus cells suggest they are suffering from an occult infection - perhaps a sexually transmitted disease ( STD) which they knew they had acquired in the past, and they are worried that they can transmit this to their wife.They are also worried that this hidden infection can kill their sperm, or reduce their ability to fertilise the eggs.Doctors are also happy to \\\"treat\\\" this abnormality by putting the man on antibiotics, because these are so easy to prescribe, and because this seems to be a logical thing to do.

However, seminal fluid also contains many other cells, including the epithelial cells which line the male reproductive tract, as well as sperm precursor cells. Most laboratory technicians will report every round cell they see as a pus cell or a WBC , but most of these are actually immature sperm precursors, called spermatocytes or spermatogonia , which look exactly the same. However, most labs don't have the special stains needed to identify whether this round cell is a WBC or not , which is why they will report all the round cells as pus cells !The doctor then promptly prescribes antibiotics, but this is a complete waste, because there was no infection in the first place, and antibiotics will not cause the sperm precursor cells to go away !Patients end up wasting a lot of time and money on taking antibiotics .

Prototyping and prototype testing should proceed in iterative loops until a dominant design emerges.  Based on test feedback, designers should reject some prototypes and refine others, producing higher-fidelity versions.  Once they converge on a single, favored solution, it\\\\u2019s time for minimum viable product testing. \\n\\nAn MVP is a prototype\\\\u2014a facsimile of the future product.  What distinguishes an MVP from other prototypes is how it is tested.  Rather than sitting across a table, getting verbal feedback from a reviewer, you put a prototype that seems like a real product in the hands of real customers in a real-world context.  The goal is to quickly but rigorously test assumptions about the demand for your solution\\\\u2014and gain what Eric Ries calls \\\\u201cvalidated learning\\\\u201d\\\\u2014with as little wasted effort as possible.  A good MVP should embody the lowest fidelity possible to get reliable feedback because lower fidelity implies less wasted effort.  Put another way, an MVP should provide no more \\\\u201clooks like\\\\u201d polish and \\\\u201cworks like\\\\u201d functionality than is strictly necessary to conduct a test.  Functionality comes in two flavors.  Front-end functionality encompasses everything directly experienced by customers; for Wings it was daters\\\\u2019 profiles, daily matches, messaging, search, etc.  Back-end functionality is invisible to the customer but integral to serving them.  For Wings, this would include the life-stream connectors, the matching algorithm, the servers, etc. \\n\\nMVPs come in four basic types, depending on whether they constrain front-end functionality, back-end functionality, or both:\\n\\nConstrained Front-End Functionality.  These MVPs omit peripheral product features and focus only on the solution\\\\u2019s core front-end features.  If customers don\\\\u2019t perceive the core features to be valuable, there\\\\u2019s no point in building the rest. \\n\\nConstrained Back-End Functionality.  MVPs can rely on makeshift, temporary methods to perform functions that are not visible to the customer\\\\u2014for example, having humans analyze digital data to suggest matches instead of relying on software algorithms.  Again, there\\\\u2019s no point in investing in automation until demand is validated.\",\n",

The preferences of the preferred shares are usually in case of a liquidation event and special rights, as will be described later in the table.      Company Valuation   This is the main deal, together with the amount that constitutes the transaction (\\\\u201cHow much for how much? \\\\u201d).  Valuation defines how much what was built so far is worth.  There is no methodological way to define it, so most likely it will be negotiated based on your alternatives.  It is defined as pre-money valuation, which is the value of what was created so far, and together with the investment amount, that forms the post-money valuation\\\\u2014the value of the company once the round is finalized.  There will be an immediate derivative of this valuation, which is PPS (Price Per Share) and number of shares in the company (prior to the round).    Mathematically, this is: pre-money valuation = PPS \\\\u00d7 number of shares prior to the round.  And then the company issues new shares to the investors at the same PPS in a total amount of the investment amount.    One note: It is important to realize that while ISO/ESOP is critical to attract and retain employees, it is mostly used by the investor as a way to lower valuation.  ISO/ESOP allocation requires issuing more shares, a new share per option, essentially increasing the number of shares and therefore lowering the PPS.  So, a $10 million pre-money valuation with 10 percent ISO/ESOP is actually less than $9 million.  It is common practice that ISO/ESOP allocation comes from current shareholders and not new ones.  To have better negotiation leverage you will need another competitive offer.      Pre-emptive Rights; Right of First Refusal; Co-Sale   Pre-emptive rights\\\\u2014The investor will have the right to participate in the next round to maintain its holding; so, for example, an investor with 10 percent of the company that participates in the next round can maintain its 10 percent position.  While it may seem fine that all they want is to increase their position, it may discourage the next investor.  Or, even worse, the next investor may ask for similar terms!

If your appraiser decides that one, or more, should be marked as 'disagree', this sends a message to you, your next appraiser and the responsible officer (RO) that something may not be ready for revalidation. This is not, in itself, a bad thing. It is an important part of ensuring that the appraisal supports you in preparing a portfolio of supporting information appropriate for a positive recommendation to revalidate. Ultimately, your RO makes the decision about your revalidation recommendation, not your appraiser.\\nContent from: Mythbusters@RCGP\\n\\n*Key Insights:*\\n*Concern Addressed:*\\n- The video addresses a common worry doctors might have \\\\u2013 what happens if their appraiser disagrees with one of the sign-off statements during the appraisal meeting.\\n*Five Key Sign-off Statements:*\\n- The video mentions five key sign-off statements that are typically agreed upon by the appraiser at the end of the appraisal. Disagreement with any of these statements is discussed in the video.\\n*Implications of Disagreement:*\\n- If the appraiser marks one or more statements as disagree, it signals to the doctor, the next appraiser, and the Responsible Officer (RO) that something may not be ready for revalidation. The video emphasizes that this isn't necessarily negative but a crucial part of the revalidation process.\\n*Decision-Making Authority:*\\n- The ultimate decision about revalidation recommendation lies with the Responsible Officer (RO) and not solely with the appraiser.\\n*Explanation Boxes:*\\n- The video explains that there are two comment boxes for the appraiser and one for the doctor to provide an explanation in case of disagreement. This allows for clarity and context.\\n*Common Scenarios for Disagreement:*\\n- It's noted that disagreement might occur in scenarios where a doctor made no progress with their previous Professional Development Plan (PDP), especially if it was their first-ever appraisal or if circumstances significantly changed.\\n*Special Cases for Disagreement:*\\n- The video highlights that even the fifth sign-off statement, indicating no concerns for patient safety, might need to be marked as disagree in specific cases, such as when a doctor is under investigation.\\n*Transparent Communication:*\\n- Transparent communication is stressed, with the doctor having the opportunity to enter comments in the provided box, fostering understanding and collaboration in the appraisal process.\",\n",

An electronic portfolio is not mandatory for revalidation, offering flexibility in the choice of format.\\n\\nRecommendations for Portfolio: It is recommended that the portfolio includes all core elements required by the GMC. The suggested format is professionally presented, typed for legibility, and capable of electronic transmission.\\n\\nConfidentiality of Supporting Information: Certain supporting information, such as original complaint letters and handwritten complement cards, is recommended to be kept in paper form and shared privately with the appraiser to maintain confidentiality. These can then be referenced anonymously in the summary.\\n\\nMedical Appraisal Guide Model Form: The Medical Appraisal Guide model form by NHS England is highlighted as a free interactive PDF available from the NHS England website. It serves as a template for all other toolkit providers, with its use not restricted to England alone.\\n\\nNational Platforms in Scotland and Wales: In Scotland and Wales, national appraisal and revalidation platforms (SOAR in Scotland and MARS in Wales) are mentioned, providing a standardized approach for all doctors.\\n\\nResponsibility of Responsible Officers (ROs): Responsible officers may express a preference among available options, and doctors are encouraged to check with designated body requirements and variations. Special arrangements might be needed for accessibility issues related to a protected characteristic.\\n\\nMoving to a New Area: When relocating to a new area in the UK, it is advised to check if a preferred local choice of the portfolio is being used.\\n\\nPortfolio Accessibility: Doctors are reminded that the portfolio, containing all GMC-required supporting information, should be available to the responsible officer potentially at short notice.\",\n",

As the above makes clear, your RO has the discretion to consider supporting information from other settings in making their revalidation recommendation.\\nEven in UK practice, you may attend CPD events overseas. It is appropriate to check that the content of such an event is applicable to your scope of practice rather than assuming that it will be acceptable. We recommend that you discuss any proposal to include any such additional supporting information with your RO in advance of your revalidation recommendation date. It is likely that clinical work overseas will have a significant overlap with clinical work in the UK. It may well be appropriate to include supporting information relating to work overseas when it demonstrates the quality of your reflective practice.\\nIf you are unsure, use your appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what is appropriate and proportionate with your appraiser, and then agree it with your RO before your revalidation recommendation is due. Content from: Mythbusters@RCGP\\n \\n*Key Insights:*\\n*Common Query Addressed:*\\n- The video addresses a common question among appraisees: whether they can include supporting information from non-UK sources in their appraisal.\\n*Source of Content:*\\n- The information in the video is derived from Mythbusters at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), emphasizing the reliability of the content.\\n*Practice Settings Abroad:*\\n- Doctors practicing overseas, where a UK license is not required, have the discretion to include supporting information from these settings. It's at their judgment whether such information is relevant to their scope of practice.\\n*GMC Requirements:*\\n- The General Medical Council (GMC) requires that the appraisal and revalidation portfolio include supporting information for every aspect of the scope of practice requiring a UK license.\\n*Discretion in Considering Information:*\\n- The Responsible Officer (RO) has the discretion to consider supporting information from non-UK settings when making revalidation recommendations. However, it is crucial to ensure that the content is applicable to the scope of practice.\\n*Communication with RO:*\\n- Doctors are encouraged to discuss any proposal to include additional supporting information from non-UK settings with their Responsible Officer before the revalidation recommendation date.\\n*Overlap with UK Clinical Work:*\\n- Clinical work overseas may overlap significantly with work in the UK. In such cases, it might be appropriate to include supporting information related to overseas work, particularly if it demonstrates the quality of reflective practice.\\n*Reflective Practice:*\\n- The video suggests using the appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what supporting information is appropriate and proportionate.

Young startup founders are very enthusiastic, and when they get introduced to business people in different domains, they want to apply their new technology for solving existing problems in this field.

It should also include activities targeted at identifying unknown unknowns.\\n\\nInclusive Learning Activities: Any learning activity where time is spent learning something and deciding how it can be applied in current or proposed work can be counted as CPD. This extends beyond traditional courses and conferences.\\n\\nDocumentation Focus: Doctors are advised to expend time and energy documenting a sample of their most relevant and important learning. The goal is to demonstrate a balanced range of learning across the curriculum relevant to their scope of practice over the five-year revalidation cycle.\\n\\nDiverse Learning Sources: CPD is not limited to courses and conferences; it can include learning from cases, data, events, personal reading, online research, online modules, and professional conversations about clinical care. Everyday learning from work and experiences of others, especially in teams, is also valuable.\\n\\nDemonstrating Impact: It is important to demonstrate how learning, especially within primary care teams, has led to significant changes and developments. Sharing learning with others outside the usual workplace is encouraged for external calibration of ideas and processes.\\n\\nReflective Practice: For any learning activity, doctors need to reflect on what they have learned and any changes made as a result. Documentation and sharing should focus on the most valuable learning experiences.\\n\\nAvoiding Disproportionate Recording: Doctors are cautioned against doing too much and making the recording of their CPD disproportionate. Documentation should not detract from patient care, family, or leisure time.\",\n",

They say nothing about what has been learned, or any changes you have made as a result.\\nA reflective note, no matter how brief, is far more valuable evidence of reflective practice and continuing professional development than a certificate. A lot of valuable learning takes place in ways that do not\\ngenerate a certificate, such as personal reading and professional conversations with colleagues. We encourage you to think about how and what you have learnt, defining one CPD credit as one hour of learning activity as demonstrated by a reflective note on the lessons learned and any changes made as a result.\\nYou should not waste time scanning certificates of attendance into your portfolio of supporting information, unless keeping formal proof of attendance on courses that are organisational requirements may be useful\\nto you, such as Basic Life Support and Safeguarding. Appraisers should not be asking to see certificates of attendance; they should be asking what your most important new learning has been over the past year and what difference it has made to your practice.\\nMany CPD facilitators now provide certificates that include a structured format or template for you to write appropriate reflective notes about learning and planned changes that will have an impact on your practice.\\nIt is reasonable to scan these rather than rewriting the reflective note elsewhere. You can also choose not to complete the certificate at all if the reflective note is captured elsewhere in a learning log or electronic\\ntoolkit. Your aim should be to avoid duplication of effort.\\n\\nkey insight : from the provided information on Medical Appraisals in the UK is that certificates of attendance at Continuing Professional Development (CPD) events are considered proof of attendance but not sufficient evidence of learning or development. The video emphasizes that merely attending an event does not convey what has been learned or the impact on one's practice. Instead, the focus is on the importance of reflective practice, encouraging appraisers to provide reflective notes as more valuable evidence of CPD.\\n\\nThe video suggests that a brief reflective note is far more valuable than a certificate, as it demonstrates the individual's understanding of what was learned and any changes made as a result. The emphasis is on capturing the essence of the learning experience and its application to professional development. The content discourages the unnecessary inclusion of certificates of attendance in the appraisal portfolio unless required by the organization for specific courses.\\n\\nAppraisers are advised to ask about the most significant new learning over the past year and its impact on practice, shifting the focus from proof of attendance to the meaningful outcomes of the learning process. Many CPD facilitators now provide certificates with structured formats or templates for writing reflective notes, making it reasonable to include these in the portfolio.\",\n",

This process helps the GMC maintain accurate records of doctors and ensures that they meet the necessary standards to practice medicine.\\n\\nBy completing the annual return, doctors fulfill their professional obligation to stay in touch with the GMC and provide the necessary updates. It allows the GMC to monitor the status and fitness to practice of registered doctors, as well as communicate important information and updates to them.\\n\\n\\nkey insights:\\n\\nMandatory Annual Return: The GMC mandates that all UK registered doctors, whether they have a designated body or not, must complete an annual return.\\n\\nProcess for Doctors Without Designated Body: Doctors without a designated body must complete the annual return online through GMC online. They should receive an annual email reminder.\\n\\nInformation Required: The annual return process involves providing personal and professional details, current employment status, any significant health issues, and changes in employment since the last return.\\n\\nCPD Requirements: Doctors must confirm compliance with the GMC's requirements for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) by undergoing an annual appraisal and submitting the Rev 12.\\n\\nDeclaration of Criminal Convictions: Doctors are required to declare any criminal convictions or ongoing investigations, essential for assessing fitness to practice and ensuring patient safety.\\n\\nDeadline and Consequences: The deadline for completing the annual return is typically in March or April. Failure to meet the deadline may lead to removal from the medical register, requiring a restoration process.\\n\\nCommon Questions Addressed: The video anticipates and addresses common questions doctors may have about the annual return process, such as how to complete it, whether there's a fee, and when to expect reminder emails.\\n\\nGMC's Focus: The GMC's annual return process aims to maintain accurate records, monitor professional conduct and qualifications, and uphold high standards of medical practice to ensure patient safety.\",\n",

I love the sourdough base and the very authentic taste of the cheese and toppings.  I absolutely dig their quattro formaggi with the perfect blend of 4 different variants of cheese - mozzarella, Parmesan, provolone and blue cheese.  After a friends insisting I tried the Diavolo which was topped with baby aubergines which tasted amazing.  The Anna and shrooms are two other favourites.  Their garlic cheese bread is freshly baked and is perfectly seasoned.  \\\\u201d\\r \\r \\\\u201cCannot begin to state how good this place was.  Hands down the BEST pizza and garlic bread I\\\\u2019ve had in a long long time.  It was so good that in a 2 day trip to Bangalore we ended up going there twice .

I love the sourdough base and the very authentic taste of the cheese and toppings.  I absolutely dig their quattro formaggi with the perfect blend of 4 different variants of cheese - mozzarella, Parmesan, provolone and blue cheese.  After a friends insisting I tried the Diavolo which was topped with baby aubergines which tasted amazing.  The Anna and shrooms are two other favourites.  Their garlic cheese bread is freshly baked and is perfectly seasoned.  \\\\u201d\\r \\r \\\\u201cCannot begin to state how good this place was.  Hands down the BEST pizza and garlic bread I\\\\u2019ve had in a long long time.  It was so good that in a 2 day trip to Bangalore we ended up going there twice .

This involves ensuring that the documentation complies with the requirements for revalidation.\\nRO's Statutory Responsibility: The RO holds the statutory responsibility for making the revalidation recommendation to the General Medical Council (GMC). The RO's decision is based on factors such as the doctor's engagement in annual appraisal, the quality of the supporting information portfolio, and any outstanding concerns within the scope of work.\\nGMC Revalidation Decision: Ultimately, the GMC makes the revalidation decision, determining whether to continue the doctor's license to practice.\\nAppraiser as a Resource: While the appraiser does not make the revalidation decision, they are a valuable resource in helping doctors improve the quality of documentation, especially in areas such as the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\\nImportance of Engagement: The video highlights that insufficient engagement is often related to the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\\nProfessional Development Planning: Appraisers can support doctors in planning their professional development in a way that enhances the quality of their professional work.\",\n",

They can be healthcare providers, organizations setting healthcare standards and policies, or certain specialized organizations employing or contracting with doctors.\\n\\nResponsible Officer (RO): The majority of designated bodies have a Responsible Officer (RO) in place. RO is an important figure in the revalidation process and is responsible for overseeing the appraisal and revalidation of doctors within the designated body.\\n\\nPrescribed Connection: Each doctor can have only one prescribed connection to a designated body. In most cases, this prescribed connection is where the doctor performs the majority of their clinical work.\\n\\nIdentifying Designated Body and RO: Doctors can identify their designated body and RO by setting up a GMC (General Medical Council) online account. The GMC website provides a full list of designated bodies, and doctors can use an online tool under the revalidation section to confirm their designated body.\\n\\nEmployment and Prescribed Link: If a doctor is employed by an NHS organization but works for another organization through contracted sessions, their prescribed link will be to the NHS organization and its RO, regardless of the time spent outside.\\n\\nConfirmation of Designated Body: Once the designated body is confirmed, the RO should assist the doctor in identifying a suitable appraiser for the revalidation process.\\n\\nNo Designated Body Connection: If a doctor doesn't have a connection to any organization classified as a designated body, they should inform the GMC about their circumstances using their online account.\\n\\nFinding a Responsible Officer: In cases where a responsible officer cannot be found, it may be possible to identify a suitable person. The GMC website provides more information and guidance on this.\",\n",

An electronic portfolio is not mandatory for revalidation, offering flexibility in the choice of format.\\n\\nRecommendations for Portfolio: It is recommended that the portfolio includes all core elements required by the GMC. The suggested format is professionally presented, typed for legibility, and capable of electronic transmission.\\n\\nConfidentiality of Supporting Information: Certain supporting information, such as original complaint letters and handwritten complement cards, is recommended to be kept in paper form and shared privately with the appraiser to maintain confidentiality. These can then be referenced anonymously in the summary.\\n\\nMedical Appraisal Guide Model Form: The Medical Appraisal Guide model form by NHS England is highlighted as a free interactive PDF available from the NHS England website. It serves as a template for all other toolkit providers, with its use not restricted to England alone.\\n\\nNational Platforms in Scotland and Wales: In Scotland and Wales, national appraisal and revalidation platforms (SOAR in Scotland and MARS in Wales) are mentioned, providing a standardized approach for all doctors.\\n\\nResponsibility of Responsible Officers (ROs): Responsible officers may express a preference among available options, and doctors are encouraged to check with designated body requirements and variations. Special arrangements might be needed for accessibility issues related to a protected characteristic.\\n\\nMoving to a New Area: When relocating to a new area in the UK, it is advised to check if a preferred local choice of the portfolio is being used.\\n\\nPortfolio Accessibility: Doctors are reminded that the portfolio, containing all GMC-required supporting information, should be available to the responsible officer potentially at short notice.\",\n",

They can be healthcare providers, organizations setting healthcare standards and policies, or certain specialized organizations employing or contracting with doctors.\\n\\nResponsible Officer (RO): The majority of designated bodies have a Responsible Officer (RO) in place. RO is an important figure in the revalidation process and is responsible for overseeing the appraisal and revalidation of doctors within the designated body.\\n\\nPrescribed Connection: Each doctor can have only one prescribed connection to a designated body. In most cases, this prescribed connection is where the doctor performs the majority of their clinical work.\\n\\nIdentifying Designated Body and RO: Doctors can identify their designated body and RO by setting up a GMC (General Medical Council) online account. The GMC website provides a full list of designated bodies, and doctors can use an online tool under the revalidation section to confirm their designated body.\\n\\nEmployment and Prescribed Link: If a doctor is employed by an NHS organization but works for another organization through contracted sessions, their prescribed link will be to the NHS organization and its RO, regardless of the time spent outside.\\n\\nConfirmation of Designated Body: Once the designated body is confirmed, the RO should assist the doctor in identifying a suitable appraiser for the revalidation process.\\n\\nNo Designated Body Connection: If a doctor doesn't have a connection to any organization classified as a designated body, they should inform the GMC about their circumstances using their online account.\\n\\nFinding a Responsible Officer: In cases where a responsible officer cannot be found, it may be possible to identify a suitable person.

This involves ensuring that the documentation complies with the requirements for revalidation.\\nRO's Statutory Responsibility: The RO holds the statutory responsibility for making the revalidation recommendation to the General Medical Council (GMC). The RO's decision is based on factors such as the doctor's engagement in annual appraisal, the quality of the supporting information portfolio, and any outstanding concerns within the scope of work.\\nGMC Revalidation Decision: Ultimately, the GMC makes the revalidation decision, determining whether to continue the doctor's license to practice.\\nAppraiser as a Resource: While the appraiser does not make the revalidation decision, they are a valuable resource in helping doctors improve the quality of documentation, especially in areas such as the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\\nImportance of Engagement: The video highlights that insufficient engagement is often related to the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\\nProfessional Development Planning: Appraisers can support doctors in planning their professional development in a way that enhances the quality of their professional work.\",\n",

The choice of venue plays a significant role in the effectiveness of the appraisal process.\\n\\nMutual Agreement on Venue: The decision on the appraisal venue should be mutually agreed upon by both the appraisee (doctor being appraised) and the appraiser.

Appraisees should be aware of and adhere to any local requirements set by their designated bodies.\\n\\nRequirements of a Professional Venue: Regardless of the venue chosen, it should meet certain criteria, including being private, free from interruptions, and equipped with necessary facilities like internet access.\\n\\nExceptional Circumstances: In exceptional circumstances, it might be appropriate to hold an appraisal meeting in an unusual venue, such as a home office.

It helps us understand our strengths, areas for improvement and how our actions affect patients and colleagues. In the United Kingdom, collecting colleague and patient feedback is an essential part of a medical appraisal. Let's delve into how to go about it.\\nFirstly, you need to identify who will provide feedback. For colleague feedback, select a broad range of individuals who work with you in a professional capacity. This could include other doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and allied health professionals. For patient feedback, choose a representative sample from your patient population.\\nNext, we need to consider the method of collection. The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends using validated questionnaires for this purpose. These are designed to provide objective, quantifiable data. You can use the GMC patient and colleague questionnaires, or other validated tools that meet the GMC's requirements.\\nOnce you've selected your colleagues and patients, you need to distribute the questionnaires. This can be done in person, via email, or through a third-party service. It's important to ensure that the process is anonymous and confidential to encourage honest feedback.\\nAfter the questionnaires have been completed and returned, you need to analyse the feedback. Look for common themes and areas for improvement. This analysis will form a key part of your appraisal discussion.\\nLastly, it's important to act on the feedback received. Create a development plan that addresses any areas for improvement identified. This is not just a requirement for revalidation, but also a way to improve your practice and patient care.\\nTo sum up, collecting feedback is a crucial part of the medical appraisal process. It allows us to reflect on our practice, identify areas for improvement, and improve patient care. Remember, feedback is a tool for growth, not a measure of failure.\\n\\n\",\n",

Designated bodies have mechanisms to agree on postponing appraisals or approving missed appraisals for such situations.\\n\\nDifferentiation from Low Clinical Work Volumes:\\nApproved breaks in practice are distinguished from situations where doctors have low volumes of clinical work on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nOption of Deferral:\\nIf necessary, the Responsible Officer (RO) has the option to defer revalidation, providing more time for doctors to collect the required supporting information.\",\n",

By 2011, Bump had reached number eight on Apple\\\\u2019s list of the all-time most popular free iPhone apps.  Big-name investors like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz jumped on board.  Bump was listed among Time magazine\\\\u2019s \\\\u201c50 Best Android Applications\\\\u201d for 2013.  That same year, it logged a total of 125 million app downloads. \\n\\nAnd yet, by the beginning of 2014, the app was discontinued; it vanished from iPhones and Androids entirely.  What happened?  Quite simply: Bump had not achieved product-market fit.  Bump was a deceptively addictive app: It allowed you to exchange contact information (as well as photos) by physically \\\\u201cbumping\\\\u201d two phones together.  It was sexy, easy to use, and fun.  A later version allowed you to share photos with your computer by bumping the phone to your keyboard.  But there was no reason to keep using it.\",\n",

It provides health benefits that ripple through our entire bodies, from our minds into our blood, through our hearts, and into our bones.  Over the past decades, study after study has linked meaningful friendships and camaraderie to all kinds of health benefits.  They decrease our risk for cardiovascular disease; boost our immune systems; and protect us from stress, anxiety, and depression.  And when we do find ourselves trapped with a mental health problem, the more that we believe we have friends and families supporting us, the better chance we have of recovering from anxiety and depression. \\n\\n\\\\u201cJust spending time with others, even if you aren\\\\u2019t interacting, can lower your blood pressure and have a calming effect,\\\\u201d says psychologist Bert Uchino, at the University of Utah, who studies how loneliness affects our physical health. \\n\\nOn the flip side, a lack of social support worsens mental health problems, forming a sort of snowball effect, Bert says.  Loneliness can cause anxiety, depression, and sleep problems, which in turn cause more loneliness.  \\\\u201cWhen people don\\\\u2019t have social support, their bodies have signs of physical stress.  They look like they\\\\u2019re being threatened.  Like people are out to get them,\\\\u201d Bert says. \\n\\nSocial support is so important for physical health that, in one study, having strong relationships correlated just as strongly with a longer life expectancy as being physically active or cutting out smoking.  In other words, the time and energy you spend planting and cultivating deep, fulfilling friendships is likely just as crucial to your overall well-being as your afternoon run (or even not smoking). \\n\\nMost of these studies examine adults, but social support, especially from family members, may be even more important for children, Bert says.  \\\\u201cThe quality of our early family relationships is tied to whether we suffer from loneliness and social isolation as an adult.  If a child feels nurtured by their parents and feels like they can count on them, then the child carries that with them for the rest of their lives. \\\\u201d\\n\\nIf that\\\\u2019s the case, then what happens when a child feels loved and nurtured not by just two parents, but by three, four, even five alloparents? \\n\\nSome anthropologists believe that alloparenting gives children something that sounds almost magical: trust in the world.\",\n",

This is why IVF patients are often completely confused about what to expect. Actually , it's very straightforward and logical, and if you understand this simple framework , you will be able to make sure your doctor's doing the right stuff for you. Remember that all we are doing in an IVF cycle is replicating what should have happened normally in the fallopian tubes - the only difference is that we are doing this in the test tube ! 1. First is the pre-IVF testing, or the workup. These are simple tests, to make sure whether IVF is the right treatment for you; and what kind of IVF you require ( for example, if this should be IVF or ICSI).(a). semen analysis for your husband ( to check his sperm count and motility); (b) blood tests for you for the following reproductive hormones - FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone),LH ( luteinising hormone),PRL ( prolactin) , AMH ( anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of your cycle, ( to check the quality of your eggs). (c) A vaginal ultrasound scan on Day 10 or 11 which should check for a. ovarian volume; b. antral follicle count; c. uterus morphology; d. endometrial thickness and texture, to confirm your uterus is normal. If there is a problem, then this can be treated prior to starting IVF! 2. Second is the stage of superovulation , where the doctor gives you hormonal injections in order to help you to grow lots of eggs. The growth of the follicles is monitored using vaginal ultra sound scans and blood estradiol levels. 3. The third step is that of egg collection ( egg retrieval) , where he collects the eggs from your mature follicles, and sends them to the embryologist in the IVF lab, where they are placed in culture medium. 4. Then comes fertilization, where either using IVF or ICSI, the embryologist adds sperm to the egg. 5. Then is the process of embryo culture, where the embryos are grown in the IVF laboratory in the incubator, so they divide and grow , till they form blastocysts. 6. This is followed by embryo transfer, where the embryos are put back in the uterus with the hope that they will implant. 7. The final step is that of cryopreservation (freezing for storage) where the extra embryos can be frozen in liquid nitrogen , so that they can be used for future attempts. This ensures nothing is wasted or thrown away.\",\n",

While they offer decent infrastructure, the problem which plagues them is the lack of quality teachers, because good teachers don't want to live in villages. Here's a solution. One responsible parent could offer to supervise each class. The students would learn together, by watching a digital channel, which would provide high quality educational content, tailored to their class syllabus, in their local language. The parent would be responsible for maintaining discipline - something which parents are good at doing! This would be an additional source of income for them as well. This strategy  will reduce dependence on teachers, and absenteeism will no longer be a problem, because parents are highly invested in their children's education. It will ensure students don't bunk classes, and pay attention in school. Peer to peer learning is a very effective way to learn. This option will offer standardised high quality lessons; and will allow parents to supervise their children and monitor their studies, because they are more actively engaged in their education!

As part of their role, your appraiser will document your appraisal and provide an output summary for your responsible officer (RO).\\nYour RO has the statutory responsibility for making a revalidation recommendation to the GMC.\\nTheir decision is based on their determination about whether you have sufficiently engaged in your annual appraisal, provided a portfolio of supporting information that meets the GMC requirements,\\nand whether there are any outstanding concerns for any part of your scope of work. The GMC will make the revalidation decision about whether to continue your licence to practise. \\n\\nKey Insight:\\n\\nRole of Appraisers: Appraisers play a crucial role in documenting and summarizing a doctor's annual appraisal. However, they do not have the authority to make the revalidation recommendation.\\nResponsible Officer's Role: The responsibility for making a revalidation recommendation lies with the Responsible Officer. This officer evaluates whether the doctor has actively participated in the annual appraisal, submitted a portfolio meeting GMC requirements, and addresses any concerns in their scope of work.\\nGMC Decision: The General Medical Council (GMC) is the ultimate decision-maker for revalidation. They determine whether a doctor's license to practice should continue based on the recommendation provided by the Responsible Officer.\\nCritical Criteria: Engaging in annual appraisal, providing a portfolio meeting GMC requirements, and addressing any concerns within the scope of work are critical criteria influencing the revalidation decision.\",\n",

As the above makes clear, your RO has the discretion to consider supporting information from other settings in making their revalidation recommendation.\\nEven in UK practice, you may attend CPD events overseas. It is appropriate to check that the content of such an event is applicable to your scope of practice rather than assuming that it will be acceptable. We recommend that you discuss any proposal to include any such additional supporting information with your RO in advance of your revalidation recommendation date. It is likely that clinical work overseas will have a significant overlap with clinical work in the UK. It may well be appropriate to include supporting information relating to work overseas when it demonstrates the quality of your reflective practice.\\nIf you are unsure, use your appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what is appropriate and proportionate with your appraiser, and then agree it with your RO before your revalidation recommendation is due. Content from: Mythbusters@RCGP\\n \\n*Key Insights:*\\n*Common Query Addressed:*\\n- The video addresses a common question among appraisees: whether they can include supporting information from non-UK sources in their appraisal.\\n*Source of Content:*\\n- The information in the video is derived from Mythbusters at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), emphasizing the reliability of the content.\\n*Practice Settings Abroad:*\\n- Doctors practicing overseas, where a UK license is not required, have the discretion to include supporting information from these settings. It's at their judgment whether such information is relevant to their scope of practice.\\n*GMC Requirements:*\\n- The General Medical Council (GMC) requires that the appraisal and revalidation portfolio include supporting information for every aspect of the scope of practice requiring a UK license.\\n*Discretion in Considering Information:*\\n- The Responsible Officer (RO) has the discretion to consider supporting information from non-UK settings when making revalidation recommendations. However, it is crucial to ensure that the content is applicable to the scope of practice.\\n*Communication with RO:*\\n- Doctors are encouraged to discuss any proposal to include additional supporting information from non-UK settings with their Responsible Officer before the revalidation recommendation date.\\n*Overlap with UK Clinical Work:*\\n- Clinical work overseas may overlap significantly with work in the UK. In such cases, it might be appropriate to include supporting information related to overseas work, particularly if it demonstrates the quality of reflective practice.\\n*Reflective Practice:*\\n- The video suggests using the appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what supporting information is appropriate and proportionate.

Not in a demanding manner, but as a matter of fact - as an entrepreneur, you deserve to know this. The key is not to select the investor that gives the best answer, it is to select someone who is honest and trustworthy. You want to be on the same page regarding the contribution of people that have the privilege of sitting on your cap table.Some softer guidelinesToo many cooks will spoil the brothThe fewer investors, the better. If investors come in as a group, please ensure you are dealing with just one nominee. It is very easy to run around like a headless chicken when there are multiple investors seeking your bandwidth in diverse and opposite directions. This is the shortest route to a catastrophe.Familiarity is your best betVenture capitalists that have been former entrepreneurs will always be the better investor than a finance guy! Not only will you find more empathy from them, but they will also be more humble than a number-crunching excel gymnast that has not been in the trenches before!Fund vs IndividualThis is a personal choice. An individual investor or family office will be far more flexible and have a longer horizon than a VC fund. However, a VC fund \\\"should\\\" ideally be able to offer far more support.Closing commentsPeople are investing to get a return. Do expect hard negotiation on entry valuations, and rights. But in all the cold hard numbers and facts, please remember to look for 'heart'. If the investor only desires to earn money from this engagement without the urge to create a long-lasting business, walk away. Entrepreneurship, like marriage, is a long and difficult journey with many ups and downs.Find someone you also want to wake up to, not just someone you want to go to bed with.\",\n",

While the gestational sac is seen within the uterine cavity and has regular margins, confirming this is an intrauterine pregnancy, this pregnancy is growing slower than expected. The yolk sac can be seen clearly, but the fetus is much smaller than it should be. The fetal pole has a CRL of only 4 mm, which corresponds to a gestational age of only 6 weeks. A repeat scan will need to be done to see how the pregnancy progresses - another week of anxiety, during which all the doctor can do is wait and watch!This scan was done for a 32-year-old with an 8 weeks pregnancy with severe abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound scan is very worrisome. This patient is likely to abort spontaneously. The bleeding within the uterus is seen as a subchorionic hematoma. While this is not a cause for concern, the fact that the gestational sac is irregular; and that no fetal pole can be seen at 8 weeks of the pregnancy confirms this is a non-viable pregnancy.This patient presented with vaginal bleeding at 7 weeks of pregnancy. The collection of blood outside the placenta within the uterus is called a subchorionic hematoma. This is old blood and does not harm the baby. It will most likely get reabsorbed as the pregnancy grows. A repeat scan after 2 weeks will provide a lot of reassurance.This is a healthy pregnancy of 8 weeks gestational age. The baby is 20 mm in size ( labeled as CRL, or crown-rump length), which is appropriate for dates. Seeing this image provides a lot of reassurance that the pregnancy is doing well.This is a healthy 7-week pregnancy as seen by a transabdominal scan. As you can see, the quality of this image is much worse as compared with the transvaginal scan image ( which was done at the same time ) below. This is why most pregnancy scans are now done transvaginally. This is safe and does not harm the baby at all. Remember that the probe is in the vagina, while the baby is in the uterus!This is the same healthy 7-week pregnancy as seen by a transvaginal scan. As you can see, the quality of this image is much better as compared with the transabdominal scan image above.The color seen on the image is a color Doppler and shows blood flow during a healthy pregnancyAn M-mode Doppler allows the doctor to show you the heartbeat of your baby.\",\n",

They use a mindless checklist approach - which can drain quite a bit of blood - and money ! Many of these tests are pointless, because they provide little useful information. However, this seems to be the norm, especially in large IVF centers ( which are run as mills and employ a huge number of doctors); as well as in the US, where testing is often done for non-medical reasons.We prefer taking a simplified, patient-friendly approach by focusing on what is medially important.

This is why IVF patients are often completely confused about what to expect. Actually , it's very straightforward and logical, and if you understand this simple framework , you will be able to make sure your doctor's doing the right stuff for you. Remember that all we are doing in an IVF cycle is replicating what should have happened normally in the fallopian tubes - the only difference is that we are doing this in the test tube ! 1. First is the pre-IVF testing, or the workup. These are simple tests, to make sure whether IVF is the right treatment for you; and what kind of IVF you require ( for example, if this should be IVF or ICSI).(a). semen analysis for your husband ( to check his sperm count and motility); (b) blood tests for you for the following reproductive hormones - FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone),LH ( luteinising hormone),PRL ( prolactin) , AMH ( anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of your cycle, ( to check the quality of your eggs). (c) A vaginal ultrasound scan on Day 10 or 11 which should check for a. ovarian volume; b. antral follicle count; c. uterus morphology; d. endometrial thickness and texture, to confirm your uterus is normal. If there is a problem, then this can be treated prior to starting IVF! 2. Second is the stage of superovulation , where the doctor gives you hormonal injections in order to help you to grow lots of eggs. The growth of the follicles is monitored using vaginal ultra sound scans and blood estradiol levels. 3. The third step is that of egg collection ( egg retrieval) , where he collects the eggs from your mature follicles, and sends them to the embryologist in the IVF lab, where they are placed in culture medium. 4. Then comes fertilization, where either using IVF or ICSI, the embryologist adds sperm to the egg. 5. Then is the process of embryo culture, where the embryos are grown in the IVF laboratory in the incubator, so they divide and grow , till they form blastocysts. 6. This is followed by embryo transfer, where the embryos are put back in the uterus with the hope that they will implant. 7. The final step is that of cryopreservation (freezing for storage) where the extra embryos can be frozen in liquid nitrogen , so that they can be used for future attempts. This ensures nothing is wasted or thrown away.\",\n",
